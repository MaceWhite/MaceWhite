Hello! I'm Smirkjuice! I am a C++ programmer who's also getting into other low to mid-level languages, like C and Assembly!
Some languages that I want to learn include: 
- Rust, 
- Java, 
- Go, 
- Kotlin, 
- CUDA-C++
- GLSL
- More C#
- More C
 and more!
^If you can't tell, I really like coding :)^

Currently, I'm rewriting the [SDK of Blade and Sorcery](https://github.com/KospY/BasSDK) in C++, just because I'm bored :)
