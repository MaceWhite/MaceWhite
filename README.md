Hello! I'm Smirkjuice! I am a C++ programmer who's also getting into other low to mid-level languages, like C and Assembly!
Some languages that I want to learn include:

- Even more C++

I also plan on doing some things with graphics libaries such as SDL and OpenGL

If you can't tell, I really like coding :)
